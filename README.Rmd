###Protein grouping of X!tandem output

**group\_Xtandem\_Filtered.pl** is a perl script used to remove redundant proteins identified with the same set of peptides when proteins are filtered using **ProcessSearchResults.pl** script in the [Proteomics Toolset](https://sourceforge.net/projects/proteomicstools/). When spectral files are searched against a target and a decoy database using **X!tandem**, ProcessSearchResults.pl filters peptides using false discovery rate (FDR).Hits from the target search are evaluated as possible outliers with respect to the decoy distribution and a probability score of being correct is associated to each. Peptides with at least 95% probability of being correct are accepted.

When the target database used for protein identification with X!tandem is a composite database containing several strains of the same species, their is a chance that orthologs across species are identified with the same set of peptides over and over again. In such a scenario, if you only wish to retain a unique set of proteins in the result file that are of interest to you, **group\_Xtandem\_Filtered.pl** will remove redundant entries and group them as one. 

If two or more proteins are identified with identical set of spectra, only one protein ID (preferentially from the strain of interest) would be retained in the protein list, the remaining protein IDs would be grouped together.  If two or more proteins from  the strain of interest are identified with identical set of spectra, all those identifications are retained (in order to retain isoforms).  

Script can be modified to identify/filter strain of interest whose proteins you wish to retain.
